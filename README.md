# GitHub Contributions API

This is a GitHub contributions API that scrapes data from [https://github.com/users/user/contributions](https://github.com/users/mattcroat/contributions) and returns the GitHub contributions data as JSON using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

To retrieve your GitHub contributions you can `fetch` the API at `http://api.com/user/year`.

Please don't use the API in a serious project and instead host it yourself on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) which takes a minute and gives you peace of mind.
