# GitHub Contributions API

The [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) GitHub contributions API scrapes the data from GitHub and returns the GitHub contributions data as JSON.

If you want to use the API in a real project, host it yourself on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) which takes a minute but gives you peace of mind in case it ever goes down.

You can watch the video how I made this API on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-lBPpeokfY) if you want to learn more about web scraping with SvelteKit.
